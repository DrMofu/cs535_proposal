\section{Problem description}
Multimodal sentiment analysis is the task of performing sentiment analysis given multiple data sources (vision, audio, language).
A good understanding of this task can help us better understand human social behavior and benefit human-computer interaction since human communication is multimodal and emotional.
Our research topic is highly related to our course \textit{Multimodal Probabilistic Learning of Human Communication}, since sentiment is an important part of human communication, and multimodal data processing is crucial for our task.
